# CUDA Accelerated NanoGPT

This project aims to accelerate the NanoGPT implementation using CUDA. Currently, the focus is on accelerating the attention mechanism. The `orquestate.py` script compares the outputs from the C and Python implementations and measures their execution times.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies (not yet but it is only torch):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the comparison and timing tests, execute `orquestate.py`
